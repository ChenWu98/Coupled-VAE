Code for the ACL 2020 paper ''On the Encoder-Decoder Incompatibility in Variational Text Modeling and Beyond''<br>
Chen Wu, Prince Zizhuang Wang, William Yang Wang

## Overview
* We implement various VAE models and augment them with our proposed Coupled-VAE approach. Text modeling experiments on PTB, Yelp, and Yahoo are under the ``Coupled-VAE/`` directory.
* We generalize our approach to conditional text modeling. Experiments on Switchboard (dialogue modeling) are under the ``Coupled-CVAE/`` directory.
