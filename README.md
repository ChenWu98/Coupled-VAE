# Coupled-VAE
Code for the ACL 2020 paper ''On the Encoder-Decoder Incompatibility in Variational Text Modeling and Beyond''<br>
Chen Wu, Prince Zizhuang Wang, William Yang Wang

## Overview
* We implement various VAE models and augment them with our proposed Coupled-VAE approach. Text modeling experiments on PTB, Yelp, and Yahoo are under the ``Coupled-VAE/`` directory, with two exceptions, for which we modify the open-sourced implementations and adopt their experimental settings:
    - ``Coupled-SA-VAE/`` is based on [SA-VAE](https://github.com/harvardnlp/sa-vae)
    - ``Coupled-Lagging-VAE/`` is based on [Lagging-VAE](https://github.com/jxhe/vae-lagging-encoder)
* We generalize our approach to conditional text modeling. Experiments on Switchboard (dialogue modeling) are under the ``Coupled-CVAE/`` directory.
